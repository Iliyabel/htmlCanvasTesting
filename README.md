# htmlCanvasTesting
This is a repo for me experimenting this the canvas element in html 5. 



## Interactive Circles
Circles of various colors, sizes, and speeds are generated and will keep bouncing against the windows' borders.
When a mouse is within 50 pixels of these circles, they will grow once they leave the mouse radius and shrink.
